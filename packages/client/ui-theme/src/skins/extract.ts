/**
 * Turn a photograph into a skin.
 *
 * The four seeds a skin is built from are read out of the image itself: the
 * background the picture mostly is becomes `surface`, the most saturated colour
 * that carries real area becomes `accent`, a second distinct hue becomes
 * `secondary`, and `text` is the far end of the neutral ramp tinted to match.
 * Everything after that is the same derivation the built-in skins go through,
 * so a custom skin lands on the same contrast structure rather than on a second
 * set of rules.
 *
 * Then the wash gets tuned. A built-in skin ships an art-directed hero and a
 * fixed veil; a custom one has whatever the user picked, so the veil is raised
 * until body text clears its threshold against the *composite* — the surface
 * washed over the brightest and the darkest part of that particular
 * photograph — rather than against the bare surface the audit normally assumes.
 * A bright photo behind a light skin is exactly the case where the two numbers
 * come apart.
 *
 * Pixel input is a plain RGBA array, so this file has no DOM dependency and the
 * whole path is testable without a canvas.
